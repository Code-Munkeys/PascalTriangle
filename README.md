Pascal Triangle
===============

Developer: Franz-Josef Ayestaran

The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row n = 0 at the top. The entries in each row are numbered from the left 
beginning with k = 0 and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows. A simple construction of the triangle proceeds in the 
following manner. On row 0, write only the number 1. Then, to construct the elements of following rows, add the number directly above and to the 
left with the number directly above and to the right to find the new value. If either the number to the right or left is not present, substitute a 
zero in its place. For example, the first number in the first row is 0 + 1 = 1, whereas the numbers 1 and 3 in the third row are added to produce 
the number 4 in the fourth row.
